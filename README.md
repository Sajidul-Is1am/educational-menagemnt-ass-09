# Five Project Featured

- First I decided to create a website related to educational conference and then I created the home page banner and navigation section based on it.
- Then I created the service part.There are six types of services.Anyone can take service from here according to their needs.And each service has a button that can be viewed by clicking on that button as desired.
- Then a functionality has been added to the details page if a user is not in login status then they cannot go to the details page and will be taken directly to the login page.
- Besides, two more private routes have been set on this website, if the user is not logged in, they will not be able to see those two routes and will not be able to see their features.
- If the user is logged in, he can access the Special Event and Venue sections.These pages list what special events they have and where they will be at the conference, where to eat and drink, and overview.
